# Agents Guide — SIMP

**Use the root hub:** [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) (or [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)) for the full agents guide, Start Here, Key References, and Code Standards.

This file exists so that opening `.context/` still points you to the same guide. All content is maintained in the root **CLAUDE.md** and **AGENTS.md**.
